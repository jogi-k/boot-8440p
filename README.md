# boot-8440p
A rather simple Arduino Sketch for a Teensy LC to boot from USB.


- sending the respective keystrokes via Teensy to Elitebook 8440p on power-on
- Uses teensyduino, tested with Teensy-LC with Arduino 1.8.5
- A great way to "debug" these kind of keyboard-simulators is to use the tool: key-mon (under Linux)
